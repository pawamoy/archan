    Where feasible, a protection mechanism that requires two keys to unlock it
    is more robust and flexible than one that allows access to the presenter of

    mechanism is locked, the two keys can be physically separated and distinct
    programs, organizations, or individuals made responsible for them. From
    then on, no single accident, deception, or breach of trust is sufficient to
    compromise the protected information. This principle is often used in bank
    safe-deposit boxes. It is also at work in the defense system that fires a
    nuclear weapon only if two different people both give the correct command.
    In a computer system, separated keys apply to any situation in which two or
